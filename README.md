# Scheels Project

The goal of the exercise is to show off skills and creativity.

# TODOs

1. Create Base App ... check.
2. Clean Up Project, removing unnecessary files ... check.
3. Implement Base Functionality ... check.
4. Make the code DRY ... check (probably more opportunities that I am not seeing at the moment.)
5. Set up Unit Tests with a popular library (such as Jest) ... if I had more time, would add unit tests to the two functions, range() and fizzbuzz()
6. Look for ways to improve code and UI ... check.
